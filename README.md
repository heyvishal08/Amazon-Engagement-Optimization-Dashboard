A data-driven Power BI dashboard that maps the entire **user journey on Amazon** — from first click to final purchase. It identifies critical drop-off points, pinpoints underperforming platforms, and uncovers actionable opportunities to optimize **engagement**, **conversion**, and **retention**.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Amazon attracts **millions of users daily**, yet only a **small fraction convert into buyers**. The core question:

> *“Where exactly are users dropping off — and what can we do about it?”*

This project dives deep into the **engagement funnel**, analyzing how users behave across traffic sources, devices, and conversion stages to reveal gaps, friction points, and untapped opportunities.
